# Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The objective was to write a series of tests using Jasmine to test the existing features of the application. 


## How to Run the Project

* Clone this Repository or download the ZIP file
* Run index.html file in a web browser
* The upper part of the screen has the functionality of the app and the lower part displays the results of the tests. 
* Tests are run when the page loads.
* 

## Tests Written:

* A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
* A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
* A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
* A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
